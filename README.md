# 🏦 Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the U.S. consumer banking industry using machine learning techniques.  
The goal is to help banks identify at-risk customers so they can proactively improve retention strategies, reduce costs, and increase profitability.

## 📌 Project Description

As the U.S. consumer banking industry expands, so do customer expectations. Retaining existing customers is far more cost-effective than acquiring new ones—according to Brillio, "acquiring a new customer is six to seven times more costly than keeping an existing one."  

However, a study from Invesp shows that many companies still spend more on acquisition than retention, which is a costly mistake. Current customers not only spend more but are also more open to exploring new products.  

By analyzing churn patterns, banks can improve customer satisfaction, prioritize high-risk groups, and boost overall retention rates.

## 🎯 Objectives

The primary challenge is to **develop a predictive system** that identifies customers most likely to leave the bank.  

Key goals:
- Build a **classification model** to predict churn.
- Explore **predictors of customer departure**, such as:
  - Are female customers leaving more than males?
  - Which **age groups** are more likely to churn?
  - Are departures associated with **specific countries** (France, Spain, Germany)?
  - Is **salary** linked to churn?

- **Sample**: 10,000 customers randomly selected over a six-month period.
- **Attributes**: Customer churn status + 12 demographic and banking features.
- **Countries**: France, Spain, Germany.

## ❓ Research Question

Can we use customer data to predict which customers will stay or exit?  

This insight will help the bank design **targeted marketing strategies** and retention programs to minimize churn and maximize customer lifetime value.
